# National Library of Mongolia Digital Archive Website

[http://nlm.asianclassics.org/](http://nlm.asianclassics.org/)

The Digital Archives for the [National Library of Mongolia](http://nationallibrary.mn/en/) created as part of the Preservation initiative currently underway. The National Library of Mongolia (NLM) is partnering with two US organizations to scan and catalog its large collection of Tibetan Buddhist texts. The [Asian Classics Input Project](https://asianclassics.org) and the [Buddhist Digital Resource Center](https://www.tbrc.org/#!footer/about/preservation) are providing funds and working with the Director of the National Library of Mongolia, Ichinkhorloo Bayarkhuu, and her staff to do this work.

Scans and catalog information will be made available online on the websites of the National Library of Mongolia, ACIP and BDRC on an ongoing basis as work proceeds on the project.

Current staff of the project includes eight Mongolian employees based in the National Library of Mongolia and four U.S.-based staff. With support from U.S. staff, Mongolians are pulling uncatalogued volumes of Tibetan texts from the NLM stacks; unwrapping them; cataloging them; and scanning them using technology provided by the project. All technology provided to the project—computers, monitors, cameras, scanners–will be donated to NLM at the conclusion of the project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

We're using the html5up.net template [Hologram](https://pixelarity.com/hologram). Shouts out to the creator [aj](http://twitter.com/ajlkn).
